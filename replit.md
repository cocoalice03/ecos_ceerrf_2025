# LearnWorlds RAG Assistant

## Overview

This is a sophisticated AI-powered educational assistant designed for integration with LearnWorlds LMS. The application provides intelligent chatbot capabilities for course content, along with ECOS (Examen Clinique Objectif Structur√©) simulation features for medical education. Built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend, it leverages vector search technology and OpenAI for conversational AI.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build System**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with connect-pg-simple
- **File Processing**: Multer for PDF uploads and processing
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured error handling

### Key Components

#### 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for document embeddings and similarity search
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o for response generation
- **Document Processing**: PDF parsing and text chunking for knowledge base
- **Context Retrieval**: Semantic search to find relevant content for user queries

#### 2. ECOS Simulation Platform
- **Patient Simulation**: AI-powered virtual patients for medical training
- **Scenario Management**: Teachers can create, edit, and manage clinical scenarios
- **Evaluation System**: Automated assessment of student-patient interactions
- **Training Sessions**: Organized learning sessions with multiple scenarios

#### 3. User Management System
- **Role-based Access**: Admin, Teacher, and Student roles with different permissions
- **Daily Limits**: Rate limiting for chatbot usage (20 questions per day per user)
- **Session Tracking**: Persistent session management across interactions

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Email-based identification with session persistence
2. **Query Processing**: User questions are processed through the RAG pipeline
3. **Vector Search**: Pinecone retrieves relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity
4. **AI Response**: OpenAI generates contextual responses using retrieved information
5. **Usage Tracking**: Daily question limits are enforced and tracked in the database
6. **ECOS Simulation**: Real-time patient simulation with conversation history and evaluation

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o for natural language processing and response generation
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for document embeddings and similarity search
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting with serverless scaling

### Development Tools
- **Replit Environment**: Development and deployment platform
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **ESBuild**: Production build optimization

### UI/UX Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20 runtime
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with HMR
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 module with automatic provisioning
- **Port Configuration**: Port 5000 for development server

### Production Deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite frontend build + ESBuild backend bundling
- **Autoscale**: Replit's autoscale deployment target
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist/public directory
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for API keys and database URLs

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management
- **Sessions**: Persistent session storage
- **Exchanges**: Chat history and conversation tracking
- **Daily Counters**: Usage limits and rate limiting
- **ECOS Tables**: Scenarios, sessions, messages, and evaluations
